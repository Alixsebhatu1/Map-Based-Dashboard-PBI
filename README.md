🌍 REDD+ Investment Program Biophysical Dashboard (2017–2022)

This repository presents the REDD+ Investment Program Biophysical Dashboard, developed to visualize key environmental and biophysical indicators collected between 2017 and 2022 across multiple intervention woredas (districts). The dashboard provides insights into land restoration, rainfall patterns, elevation, and intervention coverage in Ethiopia’s REDD+ implementation areas.

📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard offers an interactive and comprehensive visualization of REDD+ intervention data, helping policymakers, researchers, and program managers monitor progress and evaluate impacts.

Key Components

🗺️ Map of Intervention Areas

Displays spatial distribution of REDD+ intervention zones.

Highlights active project areas under various land management practices.

📈 Biophysical Indicators

ANR (Assisted Natural Regeneration): 363,018 ha

AR (Afforestation/Reforestation): 23,927 ha

PFM (Participatory Forest Management): 20,248 ha

🌦️ Average Rainfall by Wereda

Visualizes rainfall distribution to assess climate variation and its effect on forest restoration outcomes.

⛰️ Elevation by Wereda

Displays elevation differences to analyze ecological variations across project areas.

📉 Average Slope by Wereda (Pie Chart)

Illustrates terrain slope proportions, which influence soil erosion risk, vegetation cover, and project feasibility.

🧭 Purpose

The REDD+ Investment Program Dashboard aims to:

Support decision-making in forest management and land restoration.

Enhance data transparency and accessibility for REDD+ stakeholders.

Facilitate monitoring and evaluation of intervention effectiveness.

Provide a visual tool for reporting on environmental outcomes.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Power BI / Tableau / ArcGIS Dashboard (for visualization)
